      <h3>
        Color Palette
      </h3>
      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
      Palette URL: <a href="https://coolors.co/396e94-e7c24f-a43312-381d2a-aabd8c" target="_blank">https://coolors.co/396e94-e7c24f-a43312-381d2a-aabd8c</a>

      <h3>
        Typography
      </h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h3>
        What questions will your visitors expect your site to answer for them? 
      </h3>
      <p>
        My website will provide all the information customers should have answers about. It will include many various things such as the full menu with description of each item, the prices of each item, pictures of the items, our hours of operation, location, and contact information. 
      </p>
      <h3>
        Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get this information or complete the actions?  
      </h3>
      <p>
        Visitors will come to my website because it will be the perfect place for them to get any information about our products as well as answer any questions that they may have about our products. The website will also have the most accurate, informative, and up to date information on everything we will be selling, pricing, and hours of operation.  
      </p>
      <h3>
        Why will people come to your site?
      </h3>
      <p class="colored">
        The reason customers will come to my site is to get insight and information about our food. Using all the information provided on their, customers will be able to determine if our location looks like a place that they would like to plan their next meal. The thought process behind the website is to make it clean and easy for customers to plan their next meal as well as get any desired information they may need before visit.
